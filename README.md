Dvorak English International Keyboard
=====================================

I started this small project to create the Dvorack International Hardware Keyborad keymap for android that was missing from my phone. This keyboard map is important to me, I know that android delivers an english dvorak layout but spanish is my native language and some sepecial characters were missing, so I've been thinking in this thing.

I made a key map a few years ago, but didn't know how to install it on my phone. The way to use that keymap back then was forcing it into the file system using root's permission in a phone that had cyanogenmod. But recently I saw this post on stackexchange https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/30256/how-to-add-a-physical-keyboard-layout referencing this other page https://sites.google.com/site/polishhardwarekbd/ that shows how to make a keymap into an apk. I thought it was simple so I made this project with the things I learned.

From my previous attempt at making this keymap layout here is a question I posted on stackexchange https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/77623/how-to-make-a-key-act-as-acute-and-apostrophe-dead-keys-problem/82223#82223. The question was me triying to understand how to make dead keys work the same way they did on a regular linux PC. I still don't like how this keys work on android but Its better that nothing.

In the proces of making this I realized that the android's normal "english international" keyboard layout was also missing the same accents and dead keys and special chars that the dvorak layout was missing, so I made both.

I hope this project helps others as the guy of the Polish keyboard project helped me.
